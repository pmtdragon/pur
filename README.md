<h2 align="center">What is this project about?</h2>
It's a translator of a database of acrynic equipment, hulls, base weapons, micromodules and hull series from the game "Space Rangers HD: A War Apart" into plain language.
There's also a calculator here that shows the actual duration of the animation in the game based on the data from the 'Main.dat' file.
<h2 align="center">How it works?</h2>
1) Convert the "Lang.dat" file of a mod into a *.txt file using the "BlockParEditor" program.<br>
2) Open the *.txt file and copy a single block of acrynic equipment, hull, base weapon, micromodule, or hull series.<br>
3) Open this translator and select the appropriate category.<br>
4) Paste the block you copied into the input field.<br>
5) Press "Convert"<br><br>

The data obtained from processing the hull series is intended for insertion into the mods manual. There, this data will be presented in a graphical format.
